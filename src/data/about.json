"For this project, I wanted to provide a more factual basis of the benefits associated with mindfulness and meditation. So often, people are turned off of meditation because it seems so shrouded in mysticism, and claims that can be seen as magical. Most serious practitioners of meditation know that there is no magic involved in the practice, but it can still be difficult to shake the stereotype when it has already taken hold. There are numerous physical benefits to meditation that have been thoroughly studied and displayed, and I think that these are good enough reasons as any for someone to seriously consider practicing meditation and mindfulness.",
"I myself practice meditation, not necessarily for the physical benefits provided, but because of why it provides for me mentally. Initially, I was skeptical of some of the claims made in meditative texts, and decided to conduct my own research to consider whether or not I should consider meditation because of its physical benefits. Though most of these physical benefits come from a long time practicing meditation, it has encouraged me to invest more in my meditative practices, and has made me more aware the damage that stress can cause to the body. Since starting regular meditation 6 or so months ago, I find that I am more energetic in the mornings, generally feel less latent pain, and am overall happier in my day to day life.",
"With this website, I hope to encourage those who are skeptical about meditation to at least take a second look before they decide to write off the practice entirely. While I may not be able to convince everyone of the efficacy of meditation, if I change the mind of even 1 person, I will consider it worthwhile. Though meditation can be initially difficult, I find that the more I practice it, the more I value it and find it enjoyable. I think that meditation is a valuable practice that anyone can pick up, and that everyone should at least try to pick up once or twice in their lives."
