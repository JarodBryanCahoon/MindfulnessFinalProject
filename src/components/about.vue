                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For this project, I wanted to provide more of a look at more of the "hard science"
                    behind meditation, and juxtapose it with pictures of how these benefits of meditation are displayed artistically.
                    From the outside, meditation can seem to be shrouded in mysticism and practiced exclusively by holy men
                    or ascetics who dedicate their entire lives to the cause. This cannot be further from the truth, but
                    it can be easy to understand why some might think this. From this perspective, it can be difficult for a
                    beginner to see the true value and meditation and mindfulness, and seem daunting to break into the practice
                    at all.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I believe that a good way to combat this "stigma" and made mindfulness more accessible
                    is to be up front with the health benefits that these practices provide, in addition to having visual representations
                    of how these certain characteristics may make you feel.
